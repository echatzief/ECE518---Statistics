    "[Statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) is the process of analyzing sample data to gain insight into the population from which the data was collected and to investigate differences between data samples. In data analysis, we are often interested in the characteristics of some large population, but collecting data on the entire population may be infeasible. For example, leading up to U.S. presidential elections it could be very useful to know the political leanings of every single eligible voter, but surveying every voter is not feasible. Instead, we could poll some subset of the population, such as a thousand registered voters, and use that data to make inferences about the population as a whole."
