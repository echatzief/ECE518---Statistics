    "# Hypothesis Testing and the T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimates and confidence intervals are basic inference tools that act as the foundation for another inference technique: statistical hypothesis testing. Statistical hypothesis testing is a framework for determining whether observed data deviates from what is expected. R contains an array of built in functions that make it easy to carry out hypothesis tests and analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing Basics\n",
    "Statistical hypothesis tests are based a statement called the null hypothesis that assumes nothing interesting is going on between whatever variables you are testing. The exact form of the null hypothesis varies from one type test to another: if you are testing whether groups differ, the null hypothesis states that the groups are the same. For instance, if you wanted to test whether the average age of voters in your home state differs from the national average, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the average ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true given sample data. If there is little evidence against the null hypothesis given the data, you accept the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is unlikely given the data, you might reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis: that something interesting is going on. The exact form of the alternative hypothesis will depend on the specific test you are carrying out. Continuing with the example above, the alternative hypothesis would be that the average age of voters in your state does in fact differ from the national average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the null and alternative hypothesis in hand, you choose a significance level (often denoted by the Greek letter $\\alpha$.). The significance level is a probability threshold that determines when you reject the null hypothesis. After carrying out a test, if the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one you observe due to chance is lower than the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This probability of seeing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed is known as the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-test is a statistical test used to determine whether a numeric data sample of differs significantly from the population or whether two samples differ from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Sample T-Test\n",
    "A one-sample t-test checks whether a sample mean differs from the population mean. Let's create some dummy age data for the population of voters in the entire country and a sample of voters in Thessalia and test the whether the average age of voters Thessalia differs from the population:"

This function finds the power of a t-test, which is probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. The type II error rate is equal to 1-power. Let's use this function to check the type II error rate of our paired t-test:"
