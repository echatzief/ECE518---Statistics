    "# Probability vs. Statistics \n",
    " \n",
    "Probability and statistics are deeply connected because all statistical statements are at bottom statements about probability. Despite this the two sometimes feel like very diﬀerent\n",
    "subjects. Probability is logically self-contained; there are a few rules and answers all follow logically from the rules, though computations can be tricky. In statistics we apply probability to draw conclusions from data. This can be messy and usually involves as much art \n",
    "as science. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability example\n",
    "You have a fair coin (equal probability of heads or tails). You will toss it 100 times. What is the probability of 60 or more heads? There is only one answer (about 0.028444) and you must know how to compute it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistics example\n",
    "You have a coin of unknown origin. To investigate whether it is fair you toss it 100 times and count the number of heads. Let’s say you count 60 heads. Your job as a statistician is to draw a conclusion (inference) from this data. There are many ways to proceed,\n",
    "both in terms of the form the conclusion takes and the probability computations used to\n",
    "justify the conclusion. In fact, diﬀerent statisticians might draw diﬀerent conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the ﬁrst example the random process is fully known (probability of heads =\n",
    ".5). The objective is to ﬁnd the probability of a certain outcome (at least 60 heads) arising\n",
    "from the random process. In the second example, the outcome is known (60 heads) and the\n",
    "objective is to illuminate the unknown random process (the probability of heads). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequentist vs. Bayesian Interpretations \n",
    "There are two prominent and sometimes conﬂicting schools of statistics: **Bayesian** and\n",
    "**frequentist**. Their approaches are rooted in diﬀering interpretations of the meaning of\n",
    "probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequentists** say that probability measures the frequency of various outcomes of an experiment. For example, saying a fair coin has a 50% probability of heads means that if we\n",
    "toss it many times then we expect about half the tosses to land heads. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesians** say that probability is an abstract concept that measures a state of knowledge\n",
    "or a degree of belief in a given proposition. In practice Bayesians do not assign a single \n",
    "value for the probability of a coin coming up heads. Rather they consider a range of values\n",
    "each with its own probability of being true. \n",
    "\n",
    "The frequentist approach has long \n",
    "been dominant in ﬁelds like biology, medicine, public health and social sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "Bayesian approach has enjoyed a resurgence in the era of powerful computers and big\n",
    "data. It is especially useful when incorporating new data into an existing statistical model,\n",
    "for example, when training a speech or face recognition system. Today, statisticians are\n",
    "creating powerful tools by using both approaches in complementary ways.\n",
